 abstract = {We present an aqk(s) polarization-parameter model to describe product angular momentum polarization from the one-photon photodissociation of polyatomic molecules in the molecular frame. We make the approximation that the final photofragment recoil direction is unique and described by the molecular frame polar coordinates (α,φi), for which the axial recoil approximation is a special case (e.g., α=0). This approximation allows the separation of geometrical and dynamical factors, in particular, the expression of the experimental sensitivities to each of the aqk(s) in terms of the molecular frame polar angles (χi,φi) of the transition dipole moment μi. This separation is applied to the linearly polarized photodissociation of polyatomic molecules (asymmetric, symmetric, and spherical top molecules are discussed) and to all dissociation mechanisms that satisfy our recoil approximation, including those with nonaxial recoil and multiple state interference, giving important insight into the geometrical properties of the photodissociation mechanism. For example, we demonstrate that the ratio of polarization parameters A0k(aniso)/A0k(iso)=β (where β is the spatial anisotropy parameter) is an indication that the dynamics can be explained by a single dissociative state. We also show that for asymmetric top photodissociation, the sensitivity to the a1k(s) parameters, which can arise either from single-surface or multiple-surface interference mechanisms, is nonzero only for components of the transition dipole moments within the v-d plane of the recoil frame.},

 abstract = {This thesis is a detailed description of three experimental investigations on aqueous interfaces. All projects made use of the microjet technology or the more recently developed flat-jet technique which enables the implementation of liquid water in vacuum chambers. In the first study presented here we show that a flat-jet created from the impingement of two liquid microjets generates a laminar turbulence-free water-water interface. By colliding a Luminol solution microjet with another microjet of hydrogen peroxide solution, the chemiluminescence of Luminol reveals where the liquids mix in the flat-jet. The liquids readily mix in the rims of the flat-jet, while in the middle part the different liquids only meet via diffusion. Flat-jets are stationary systems such that the longitudinal flow direction translates into a time dimension, providing access to the interface in different total interaction times ranging from 10 to 200 µs. This timescale is difficult to access by current techniques. The water-vacuum interface is the next topic, in which we have studied aqueous solutions using microjets and photoelectron spectroscopy (MJ-PES). For the first time, we have experimentally demonstrated the implementation of an absolute photoelectron energy reference in MJ-PES. We could show that there is a concentration-dependent shift of valence bands which were previously (without this absolute energy reference) undetectable. Even though this study was done using a tabletop He plasma light source, it creates the foundation of absolute energy referencing for MJ-PES works done in, e.g., synchrotron laboratories. Lastly, we have built an experimental apparatus to investigate the water-gas interface. Such interfaces are ubiquitous in nature but lack direct experimental works on the molecular scale, namely scattering studies. This is largely due to the technical difficulty imposed by the high vapour pressure of water. The dense layer of vapour shields the liquid surface in such a way that conventional molecular beams cannot travel to and from the liquid surface without interacting with the vapour phase, destroying the initial and final states required to understand the surface scattering event at the quantum level (transmission probability of ~e^(-100)). We propose an alternative method to this: by approaching the molecular beam source and the water flat-jet to a distance of 200 µm or less, the probability of scattering solely at the liquid surface becomes realistic. We have performed preliminary experiments using the developed apparatus.},
