abstract = {A focusing equation is developed describing the relationship between space and velocity focusing for all one-dimensional time-of-flight mass spectrometers with constant electric fields. As a result of this equation, first order double time focusing in one dimension is impossible. The possibility of large improvements in the resolving power of the time-of-flight mass spectrometers is discussed on this basis. The focusing equation also leads to an expression for the minimum time resolution obtainable. This second equation is applied to the conventional Wiley and McLaren [1] two-field time-of-flight mass spectrometer with and without time-lag focusing, and to the mirror instrument of Karataev et al. [2].}
